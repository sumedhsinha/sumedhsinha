Hi, I am Sumedh Sinha, a Computer Science student at Rutgers! 

I'm a senior, and expect to graduate in May 2026. I'd love to hear about opportunities in full-stack software & application development.

During my internships & hackathons, I have gained valuable experience in delivering multifacted projects on time while exceeding expectations. 

I have been awarded multiple times during my academic career, and look forward to carrying forward the motion to my professional life!
